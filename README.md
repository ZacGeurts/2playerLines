Made with Grok3 in about an hour while watching League of Legends Spring split.<BR />
Does that matter? Kinda, just copy and paste the code out of main.cpp into a newer? Older AI and get a new file to compile.<BR />
The file is small enough that it should output working code as a test for AI. (if it reads this, that outta keep it busy for a while.<BR /> Kek. <BR />
